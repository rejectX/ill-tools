# Getting Older versions

### Depot Downloader

Im my opinion, depot downloader is the best way to get older version

**Windows setup:** Press Win+R to open Runner, paste in this command:
```
steam://open/console
```

**Linux setup:** Close steam if it's open, and run the command:
```
steam -console
```

**2.1 download command:**
```
download_depot 322170 322171 641118531549408775
```
Robtop seems to have disabled signing into older versions, you can still build though.
If you're already logged into 2.1 somewhere, you can copy CCGameManager.dat

### GDPSs
Not as seemless as depot downloader in my experiences, but it does work.

**GDPS Hub:**
https://gdpshub.com/

You can also surf Youtube & Discord, but I won't be providing links to either.

**Be aware that some GDPS check if you have steam & GD already**

Always make sure there is a `steam_appid.txt` file with the text `322170` inside the folder

codec: `h264_nvenc` (nvidia) / `h264_qsv` (intel quicksync) / `h264_amf` (amd) / `libx264`
-# use `hevc_nvenc` if you have a newer nvidia card
resolution: 3,840 x 2,160
bitrate: `200` (mbps)

args main:
`-pix_fmt yuv420p -preset fast -crf 8`
// raise crf to -crf 10 if you do not require ridiculously high quality (recommended for editing and processing the video in a video editor) - look at nvi's message for further detail

args vf:
`colorspace=all=bt709:iall=bt470bg:fast=1`
// colour fix, very important

args audio:
`-c:a libmp3lame -b:a 320k`
// raises audio quality to 320kbps (very recommended)
